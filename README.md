# Night forest

## A consistent and simple theme

Night forest aims to be a consitent theme that allows the programmer to immersive themselves in their code...

It features a carefully designed palette so it's easy to read with your eyes with just enough colors to not feel monotonous.

I have tried to cover most panels and widgets, but in case anything is missing do let me know!~

### Language support

The theme does *not* support semantic tokens as i find it usually breaks the carefully defined colors the theme is designed around.

After testing many different languages it should have a very consistent look and feel across *all* languages that's supported by vscode, but do keep in mind that if a language extension does not provide sufficient textmate scopes, it's not possible to target/color certain things so it's not 100% the same across languages.

The following languages has been tested and confirmed to be working as intended:
* `C/C++`
* `C#`
* `Rust`
* `Zig`
* `Nim`
* `go`
* `Python`
* `Ruby`
* `crystal`
* `lua`
* `swift`
* `dart`
* `java`
* `JavaScript`
* `Typescript`
* `php`
* `css`
* `html`
* `Markdown`
* `PowerShell`
* `julia`
* `VimL`
* `.ini`
